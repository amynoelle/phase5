@book{Deitel2003Operating,
	abstract = {The third edition of \_Operating Systems\_**\_ has been entirely updated to
reflect current core operating system concepts and design considerations. To
complement the discussion of operating system concepts, the book features two
in-depth case studies on Linux and Windows XP. The case studies follow the
outline of the book, so readers working through the chapter material can refer
to each case study to see how a particular topic is handled in either Linux or
Windows XP. Using Java code to illustrate key points, \_Operating Systems\_**\_
introduces processes, concurrent programming, deadlock and indefinite
postponement, mutual exclusion, physical and virtual memory, file systems,
disk performance, distributed systems, security and more. New to this edition
are a chapter on multithreading and extensive treatments of distributed
computing, multiprocessing, performance, and computer security. An ideal up-
to-date book for beginner operating systems readers.},

network programming, program structure and execution, running programs on a
system, and interaction and communication between programs. For anyone
