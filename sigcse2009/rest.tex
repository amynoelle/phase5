\section{Future Work}

In the future, we will expand Pintos's analysis capabilities to
provide quantitative information  and include realistic
device models.
We also considering the extension of Pintos to multiple
CPUs, and the development of assignments that involve
networking and interprocess communication (IPC).
Although feedback from our industrial affiliates, who compare
students having Pintos to students having taken course that use
less concrete or external approaches, is highly favorable,
we need to perform a formal evaluation comparing learning 
outcomes using Pintos to other alternatives.
