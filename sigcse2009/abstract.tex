Pintos is an instructional operating system, complete with documentation
and ready-made, structured assignments that introduce students to the 
principles of multi-programming, scheduling, virtual memory, and file systems.
By allowing students to run their work product on actual hardware,
rather than only in simulated or emulated environments, Pintos can
increase student engagement.  Unlike tailored versions of commercial
or open source OS such as Linux, Pintos is designed from the ground up
from an educational perspective.  Finally, Pintos includes a set of
debugging, diagnosis, and dynamic analysis tools to reduce the complexity
of kernel-level development.
