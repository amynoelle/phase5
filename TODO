* The p1-4.c testcase needs significant tuning.  Currently it takes
  too long (especially when SHOW_PROGRESS is turned on) and doesn't
  show significant improvement.

* The semantics of the join system call should change so that it only
  returns the exit code once.

* mmap/munmap should use segment IDs like Nachos.  Too hard otherwise.
