* The p1-4.c testcase needs significant tuning.  Currently it takes
  too long (especially when SHOW_PROGRESS is turned on) and doesn't
  show significant improvement.

* The semantics of the join system call should change so that it only
  returns the exit code once.

* mmap/munmap should use segment IDs like Nachos.  Too hard otherwise.

* Finish writing the tour.

* Come up with a way for us to release some of the tests.

* userprog project should mark read-only pages as actually read-only
  in the page table

* Add src/testcases/vm, src/testcases/filesys and make it clear to use
  them?

* Speed up disk routines: filling an 8 MB disk takes a long time.
  (They're only slow because timer_sleep always waits for at least one
  timer tick.)
