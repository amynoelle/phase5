* Put time limits on tests.

* `make grade'

* We need better and more example programs.

  - Need an mmap example program as a replacement for the crappy mmap FAQ
    question.

* Give advice on how to use `diff' to find out what has changed

* pintos script doesn't (always?) delete temp disks

* GNU make 3.80 or later is required.

* Finish writing tour.





* process_death test needs improvement

* Internal tests.

* Improve automatic interpretation of exception messages.

* Userprog project:

  - Mark read-only pages as actually read-only in the page table.  Or,
    since this was consistently rated as the easiest project by the
    students, require them to do it.

  - Don't provide per-process pagedir implementation but only
    single-process implementation and require students to implement
    the separation?  This project was rated as the easiest after all.
    Alternately we could just remove the synchronization on pid
    selection and check that students fix it.

* Filesys project:

  - Need a better way to measure performance improvement of buffer
    cache.  Some students reported that their system was slower with
    cache--likely, Bochs doesn't simulate a disk with a realistic
    speed.

* Documentation:

  - Add "Digging Deeper" sections that describe the nitty-gritty x86
    details for the benefit of those interested.

  - Add explanations of what "real" OSes do to give students some
    perspective.

* Assignments:

  - Add extra credit:

    . Low-level x86 stuff, like paged page tables.

    . Specifics on how to implement sbrk, malloc.

    . Other good ideas.

    . opendir/readdir/closedir

    . everything needed for getcwd()
