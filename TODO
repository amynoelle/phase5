* The p1-4.c testcase needs significant tuning.  Currently it takes
  too long (especially when SHOW_PROGRESS is turned on) and doesn't
  show significant improvement.

* The semantics of the join system call should change so that it only
  returns the exit code once.

* mmap/munmap should use segment IDs like Nachos.  Too hard otherwise.

* Some confusion--do we really get overlapping ro/rw segment in normal
  link?  Student example seemed to show that we don't.

* Add qsort(), bsearch() implementations to kernel.

* Finish writing the tour.

* Come up with a way for us to release some of the tests.

* userprog project should mark read-only pages as actually read-only
  in the page table
