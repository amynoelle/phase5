HW3 DESIGN SUMMARY
==================

OVERALL

  DOCUMENTATION
    -20 Egregious violation of style versus design document example
    -10 Numerous excessively long lines (> 79 characters)
    -10 Numerous capitalization, punctuation, spelling, or grammar errors

  DESIGN
    -10 Failure to check return value of malloc()
    -10 Use of ASSERT to check something that can actually fail, e.g. malloc()

  CODING STYLE
    -10 Inconsistent or bad coding style: no indentation, cramming
        many statements into one line, other issues at TA's discretion
    -10 Numerous very long source code lines (> 100 characters)
    -10 Commented-out or #if'd out code makes real code hard to read
    -10 Many missing comments on structure, structure members,
        global or static variables, or function definitions
    -10 Function(s) should be decomposed for clarity [indicate function]
    -10 Cut-and-pasted code should be made into function [indicate where]
    -10 Uninformative or deceptive identifiers

  EXTRA CREDIT
     +5 Sharing

PROBLEM 1: PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT

  DOCUMENTATION
    -25 Grossly inaccurate: documentation has no resemblance to code
    -13 Important inaccuracies: documentation and code differ significantly
        [indicate how]
     -5 Minor inaccuracies: documentation and code differ [indicate how]
     -5 A1: Missing entirely/missing comments or purpose/too long
     -5 A2: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 A3: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 A3: Sharing implemented, but no explanation of how accessed
        and dirty bits are coordinated
     -5 A3: Sharing not implemented, but explanation states or implies
        that a page can have multiple aliases
     -5 A4: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 A5: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short

  DESIGN
    -30 Not implemented
    -10 Page dirty status must be determined accurately, not approximately

PROBLEM 2: PAGING TO AND FROM DISK

  DOCUMENTATION
    -45 Grossly inaccurate: documentation has no resemblance to code
    -23 Important inaccuracies: documentation and code differ significantly
        [indicate how]
     -5 Minor inaccuracies: documentation and code differ [indicate how]
     -5 B1: Missing entirely/missing comments or purpose/too long
     -5 B2: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 B3: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 B4: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 B4: Heuristic does not make sense
     -2 B4: Claim that "struct intr_frame" is on user stack
     -5 B5: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 B5: Claim that deadlock is "rare" or has a "short" window
     -5 B6: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -3 B6: Didn't answer first part of question
     -3 B6: Didn't answer second part of question
     -3 B5: Disables interrupts
     -5 B7: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 B8: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -3 B8: When pre-locking of pages is used, no discussion of
        deadlock prevention
     -3 B8: When global eviction lock is used, no discussion of
        how pages are brought into main memory
     -5 B9: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short

  DESIGN
    -45 Not implemented
     -5 Clock algorithm implementation literally uses a timer
    -10 Clock algorithm implementation resets dirty bits
     -5 Stack fault heuristic allows more than 32 bytes below stack pointer
     -3 Stack limit is smaller than 1 MB

     -5 Minor inaccuracies: documentation and code differ [indicate how]
     -5 C1: Missing entirely/missing comments or purpose/too long
     -5 C2: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 C3: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -2 C3: No mention of stack expansion

     -5 C4: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short

  DESIGN
    -20 Not implemented
     -5 Pre-reserves or permanently assigning file pages to frames
     -5 Pre-reserves or permanently assigning file pages to swap slots
     -5 Global counter for mapid_t lacks synchronization
     -5 Global table of file mappings lacks synchronization
     -5 Global table allows multiple processes to access same file mapping
     -5 Superfluous locking on per-thread data structure [which]
