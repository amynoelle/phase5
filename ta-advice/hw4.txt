HW3 DESIGN SUMMARY
==================

OVERALL

  DOCUMENTATION
    -20 Egregious violation of style versus design document example
    -10 Numerous excessively long lines (> 79 characters)
    -10 Numerous capitalization, punctuation, spelling, or grammar errors

  DESIGN
    -10 Failure to check return value of malloc()
    -10 Use of ASSERT to check something that can actually fail, e.g. malloc()

  CODING STYLE
    -10 Inconsistent or bad coding style: no indentation, cramming
        many statements into one line, other issues at TA's discretion
    -10 Numerous very long source code lines (> 100 characters)
    -10 Commented-out or #if'd out code makes real code hard to read
    -10 Many missing comments on structure, structure members,
        global or static variables, or function definitions
    -10 Function(s) should be decomposed for clarity [indicate function]
    -10 Cut-and-pasted code should be made into function [indicate where]
    -10 Uninformative or deceptive identifiers

PROBLEM 1: INDEX AND EXTENSIBLE FILES

  DOCUMENTATION
    -30 Grossly inaccurate: documentation has no resemblance to code
    -15 Important inaccuracies: documentation and code differ significantly
        [indicate how]
     -5 Minor inaccuracies: documentation and code differ [indicate how]
     -5 A1: Missing entirely/missing comments or purpose/too long
     -1 A1: "start" member retained in inode_disk but not used
     -2 A1: "unused" array in inode_disk should be used for block pointers
     -5 A2: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -2 A2: Didn't show work or provide enough information to reproduce 
     -2 A2: Math doesn't add up
     -3 A2: Incorrect claim to have 128 indirect or doubly indirect blocks
     -5 A3: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 A4: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 A5: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     +1 A5: Mentioned that locks and semaphores are FIFO ordered.
     -3 A5: Didn't describe one of two rules needed for fairness
     -5 A5: Didn't describe either of two rules needed for fairness
     -2 A5: Use of timer to ensure fairness
     -2 A5: Claim that "rare" events do not affect fairness
     -5 A6: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -3 A6: Mentioned only one reason

  DESIGN
    -30 Not implemented
     -5 Global lock for file extension
     -5 Check on file length followed by obtaining lock fails to recheck length
    -15 Reads or writes wait for one another, even when file not being extended

PROBLEM 2: SUBDIRECTORIES

  DOCUMENTATION
    -30 Grossly inaccurate: documentation has no resemblance to code
    -15 Important inaccuracies: documentation and code differ significantly
        [indicate how]
     -5 Minor inaccuracies: documentation and code differ [indicate how]
     -5 B1: Missing entirely/missing comments or purpose/too long
     -1 B1: Not mentioned how files and directories are distinguished
     -2 B1: Global list of open directories lacks lock
     -2 B1: Global list of directories has no way to wait for directory access
     -5 B2: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 B3: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 B4: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 B5: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -3 B5: Claim that extra code is needed to avoid deleting parents of cwds
     -5 B6: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -3 B6: Mentioned only one reason

  DESIGN
    -30 Not implemented
    -10 Use of string for current directory is slow, takes a lot of
        memory, and has undesirable semantics for directory removed
        and re-created
     -5 Use of sector number for current directory has bad semantics
        when a directory's inode is reused later
    -10 Operations on different directories must wait for one another

PROBLEM 3: BUFFER CACHE

  DOCUMENTATION
    -30 Grossly inaccurate: documentation has no resemblance to code
    -15 Important inaccuracies: documentation and code differ significantly
        [indicate how]
     -5 Minor inaccuracies: documentation and code differ [indicate how]
     -5 C1: Missing entirely/missing comments or purpose/too long
     -2 C1: Didn't drop inode_disk from struct inode
     -5 C2: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 C3: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 C4: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 C5: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -5 C6: Missing/non-responsive/too long/too short
     -2 C6: Omitted one of three workloads
     -4 C6: Omitted two of three workloads

  DESIGN
    -30 Not implemented
     -3 Modifies all cache entries on block access or eviction
    -10 Metadata are preferred over data to the extent that the cache
        will contain only metadata in many cases
     -5 Busy waits in read-ahead
     -5 Creates new thread on most reads or on every read
     -5 In some cases operations on cached blocks may have to wait for
        I/O of unrelated blocks to complete
